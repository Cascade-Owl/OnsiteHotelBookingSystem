# OnsiteHotelBookingSystem

## Overview

### This is a simple model of a real-life hotel booking system designed to simulate the process of booking customers into hotel rooms. Unlike real-life booking systems, this version is optimized for speed, allowing users to explore its features faster:

1. Customers are automatically evicted after 1 minute and 25 seconds using the AutomateCustomerLeave function.
2. The system supports 5 rooms only for simplicity.
3. The booking system does not offer 24/7 service. It only runs while the script is active, but the system saves the previous state so you can resume the booking process later.
4. Time is based on the local machineâ€™s clock (e.g., laptop or phone), not the database.


## Features and Functions
1. Add Customer: Book customers into rooms. Note that there are only 5 rooms available at once.
2. Delete Customer: Remove customers and their bookings.
3. Queueing System: Automatically queue customers when no rooms are available and assign them once rooms are vacated.
4. Automatic Room Eviction: Customers are removed from their room after 1 minute and 25 seconds, freeing the room for new customers.
5. Trigger Notifications: Track the history of room bookings and see the past appointments.


## Prerequisites
1. Python version **3.10 or higher**.
2. MySQL server (local or cloud-based).
3. MySQL Connector for Python: **mysql-python-connector** package for Python.

**Note:**
- Enter **pip install mysql-python-connector** on a terminal just in case the package does not exist in your local machine. 

## How to use
1. Run the main script **MyHotel_BookingSystem.py** on a terminal.

2. Enter your MySQL server credentials.

3. Once the connection to the database is established and initialized, you will see the main menu.

**Note**: You will be prompted for an input. In this case, only input integers from 1 to 5.

## What each function in the menu does
1. **Add Customer**
- This adds a customer to the database and then appoints it to a vacant room. If there are no vacant rooms, the customer is queued until a room becomes available and is automatically appointed a room.

2. **Delete Customer**
- This removes every record of a customer in the database associated with the inputted name. This also includes a customer who occupies a room.

3. **Show All Past Room Appointements**
- This displays the history of customers who occupied the rooms (and their customer IDs).

4. **Refresh**
- Does nothing.

5. **Exit**
- This terminates the running program.

## Important Notes
- This hotel booking system does not run 24/7. It only functions when the script is running. However, it does save the system's current state to a MySQL database. When you restart the script, it resumes from the saved state.
- The system is designed to work faster than a real hotel booking system to allow users to see its features more quickly. Each customer can only stay in a room for 1 minute and 25 seconds before being evicted.
- The system operates on local machine time, not on the time set in the MySQL database.
